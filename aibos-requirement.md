# ‚úÖ AI-BOS Hybrid OS & Micro-App Platform ‚Äì Requirements & Job List

This document is the single source of truth for the AI-BOS project. It ensures every contributor, micro-developer, and AI agent is aligned, and that the platform is scalable, secure, and developer-friendly.

---

## üåê OS SHELL (Immutable Layer)

**Goal:** The OS shell is the unchanging foundation. All micro-apps plug in via defined APIs and UI slots. No ad-hoc changes allowed after freeze.

- [ ] Freeze desktop layout (document structure, slots, and extension points)
- [ ] Freeze Dock positioning & interactions (define allowed behaviors)
- [ ] Freeze Top Bar UI (menus, system tray, user avatar)
- [ ] Define allowed OS-level states & events (document event bus, state machine)
- [ ] Document how micro-apps plug in (API, manifest, UI injection)

**Visual Polish:**
- [ ] Glassmorphism spec (blur, opacity, layering)
- [ ] Gradient backgrounds spec (tokens, usage)
- [ ] Icon sizes & styling (SVG, PNG, emoji, guidelines)
- [ ] Animation library selection (Framer Motion/CSS, standardize timing)

**Theme Tokens:**
- [ ] Define color tokens (light/dark, accent, background, border)
- [ ] Define typography tokens (font, size, weight, spacing)
- [ ] Define shadows, radii, motion tokens
- [ ] Export tokens in JSON for AI/SDKs

**Spotlight Co-Pilot (foundation):**
- [ ] Define global event bus spec (pub/sub, event types)
- [ ] Draft basic Spotlight manifest syntax (search, actions)
- [ ] Reserve keyboard shortcuts (e.g. CMD+Space)

---

## üì¶ MICRO-APP MANIFEST SYSTEM

**Goal:** Every app must provide a manifest that describes its identity, UI, APIs, data, permissions, events, and integrations. This guarantees plug-and-play compatibility.

- [ ] Integrate v1 manifest with v1.1 enhancements:
  - [ ] spaces (business domains)
  - [ ] compliance flags (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
  - [ ] theme tokens (for app theming)
  - [ ] capabilities (what the app can/can't do)
  - [ ] deployment metadata (version, author, repo)
  - [ ] localization support (i18n)
  - [ ] manifest versioning
- [ ] Write manifest documentation (examples, edge cases)
- [ ] Build manifest validation tool (CLI, web, GitHub Action)
- [ ] Return clear error messages (for AI and human devs)
- [ ] Generate README.md from manifest (manifest ‚Üí markdown converter)

---

## üöÄ DEVELOPER ECOSYSTEM / TOOLS

**Goal:** Make it easy for anyone to build, validate, and publish micro-apps that work seamlessly in AI-BOS.

- [ ] Document standard folder structure (apps, manifest, src, assets)
- [ ] Provide a sample ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù app as template
- [ ] Create GitHub starter repo (manifest schema, example app, validator, readme generator, license)
- [ ] Write developer documentation (how to build, validate, and deploy apps)
- [ ] Publish best practices (security, performance, UI consistency)

---

## üîí SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

**Goal:** Guarantee platform and app security, and make compliance easy and auditable.

- [ ] Define app sandboxing rules (no access to OS internals)
- [ ] Declare allowed permissions (manifest-driven)
- [ ] Map compliance tags (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) to manifest fields
- [ ] Prepare observability hooks for audit logs (auto-logging, export)
- [ ] Define auth model (Supabase Auth, JWT claims, app inheritance)

---

## ü™Ñ UX LUXURY POLISH

**Goal:** Deliver a premium, delightful experience for all users.

- [ ] Decide on animation library (Framer Motion or CSS)
- [ ] Standardize timing & easing curves
- [ ] Decide on sound effects (on/off, style)
- [ ] Define dark mode theme tokens
- [ ] Map design tokens to Tailwind classes
- [ ] Provide color palettes (light/dark)
- [ ] Gather visual references (screenshots, Figma, icon sets)

---

## üåé SPACES SYSTEM

**Goal:** Support domain-specific ‚Äúspaces‚Äù (Retail, Finance, Compliance, etc.) with tailored defaults and compliance rules.

- [ ] List business domains
- [ ] Define default dock icons, spotlight commands, compliance rules per space
- [ ] Add ‚Äúspace‚Äù metadata to manifest
- [ ] Document rules for space-specific apps

---

## üéØ FUTURE ROADMAP (OPTIONAL)

- [ ] Event bus integration (choose tech, define spec)
- [ ] App store / marketplace (manifest fields for monetization, metadata)
- [ ] Live collaboration features (multi-user window sync)
- [ ] Analytics layer (track app usage, dashboards for micro-devs)

---

## üìù PROJECT MANAGEMENT

- [ ] Create Trello/Notion board for all tasks
- [ ] Assign priority levels:
  - P1 = core architecture
  - P2 = UX polish
  - P3 = optional features
- [ ] Track blockers / dependencies
- [ ] Plan release milestones (OS shell freeze, manifest system, dev tools, marketplace v1)

---

## üèÜ CORE P1 DELIVERABLES (First Release)

- OS shell frozen & documented
- Theme tokens published
- Manifest spec finalized
- Validation tooling working
- Hello World micro-app repo created
- Developer docs published

---
